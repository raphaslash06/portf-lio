        <p id="p_1">Born in Ca√ßapava, Brazil, i seek to explore the world in an interactive and fun way, always learning
            more about technology and the
            internet. In this environment, I found myself welcomed by people, programs and games that have taught me and
            continue to teach me a lot with each passing day. And I really like anime, so you will probably see many
            personal
            projects related to it. Thank you for your attention, every opinion will be considered!</p>
